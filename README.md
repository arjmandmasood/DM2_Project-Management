## PC.I.Y
This application would aim to try and help people understand and know how to repair their own PC in their own home. Given the current events, it is not easy to go and get your PC repaired, so it would be beneficial to try to help people understand the simplicity of maintaining and repairing their own PC. <br>

**Objectives** <br>
This website must:
1. Successfully inform users how to clean and maintain their PC
2. Clearly explain the most important points in the process of replacing parts of a PC.
3. Try to answer any questions the user may have in an FAQ section.

**Scope** <br>
We are aiming to have the website include:
1. A homepage which includes a navigation bar which leads to the maintenance or repair parts of the page.
2. The maintenance or repair piece of the page is split as repairing a PC may be much more technical for some users. This stops users being overwhelmed if they read the wrong section.
3. Videos and images to describe the process, including text instructions.
4. An FAQ section, to answer common questions users may pose. <br>

**Benefits** <br>
Given the current circumstances, allowing users to easily find information about their PCs will help as PC repair stores are closed due to the pandemic. An issue with a PC may be some as simple as a large amount of dust causing it to overheat, or a cable being broken. It is easy to assume something bigger and more important has broken when something like this happens, and it may stop the user spending money or potential becoming stressed from not being able to access important files or memories which may be stored on the computer.
