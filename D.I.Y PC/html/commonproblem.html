							<div id="overheat"><h2>PC Overheating</h2>A heating PC slows down the whole system and leads to frequent crashes. 
							Additionally, PC components may also get permanently damaged due to constant exposure to heat.
							 There are two main reasons your PC heats up, i.e. either the cooling system isn’t working properly
							 or the PC is heating to the point your cooling system can’t handle it anymore.<br>
							Every PC has multiple components with moving parts that generate heat while working. CPU and GPU are the 
							most heat generating components. The harder these components work, the more heat is generated.<br> 
							If this heat isn’t cooled down, then it can stop the PC from working and may damage the components as well.
							Usually, computer manufacturers fit fans inside the PCs to keep the airflow going and its components cooled down.
							There could be multiple fans, one on the CPU, another on the GPU and more near other components. Also, on your laptop or desktop, you may have noticed one or more ventilation areas at the bottom or back, through which your PC fans 
							ventilate the air to keep the components from heating.<br>
							When you press the power button to start up the PC, you hear a satisfying "vroom" sound. Well, 
							that’s the sound of the fans inside, which run at full throttle at first and then slow down as the PC boots. If you can’t hear that sound when the PC starts, or maybe you feel the sound is less powerful than before, then there is a chance that the fans aren’t working well.<br>
							To investigate further, you can open up the PC to see if the fans are working or not. 
							If you are not comfortable with opening the PC, then use a flashlight to see inside the PC’s ventilation holes for running fans. If you are not able to see any movement, you should immediately take it to a repair shop before the heat melts down the components.<br><br>

							<strong>Avoid blocking the vents: </strong>
							You should never place your PC on your bed, blanket or any other soft surface while working. Such soft and uneven surfaces block the airflow from the vents, resultantly warming up the PC (especially if they are located below the PC). Instead, always place the PC on a hard surface, preferably a wooden table or laptop tray, so that the ventilation area never gets blocked.<br>

							<strong>Clean up the PC:</strong>
							If you haven’t cleaned your PC in a while, then dirt is most probably the cause of the heating PC. It is easy to clean a desktop, but laptop users may prefer to take it to a repair shop and get it serviced. If you want to clean the PC yourself, follow the below-mentioned steps:<br>

							First, completely turn off the PC and unplug it.<br>
							Now open the cover and you should be able to see visible dust. To clean it up, you can use a can of compressed air or a leaf blower (at slow speed). Blow the main PC components with air, especially the fans, from both front and back sides.<br>

							You can also use cotton buds to clean up the narrow spaces. However, don’t worry if you can’t get it sparkly cleaned, as we are just looking to get rid of any blockage caused by dust.<br>
							I had the same problem with my heating PC. It would go over 80°C with only a few hours of use. A good blow with a leaf blower got rid of all the dust and now it hardly goes near 55°C at max usage.<br>

							<strong>Reapply thermal paste:</strong>
							Thermal paste is usually a highly conductive material that is applied between CPU/GPU and heatsinks. This paste ensures that the heat is properly moved out of the PC. If this material gets old, it will definitely affect the effectiveness of the cooling system.
							</div><br>
							<div id="dysfunctional"><h2>Dysfunctional USB Port</h2>If your USB port stops working, it’s not necessary that it’s broken. Below are some solutions that can fix this issue:
							<br>
							<strong>Method 1: Restart the PC</strong>
							Restarting the PC is the answer to many problems, and it is a common solution to USB port problem as well.
							<br>
							<strong>Method 2: Uninstall USB port driver</strong>
							Uninstalling the driver of the USB port will force Windows to reinstall it when you will restart the PC. This may fix the problem. Here is how to do it:
							<br>
							Press Windows + R keys and enter devmgmt.msc in the Run dialog to open the Device Manager.
							Here, expand Universal Serial Bus controllers option.
							Now right-click the entry USB Host Controller and then click on Uninstall.
							Repeat this for all entries with USB Host Controller to uninstall drivers for all the USB ports.
							Once deleted, restart the PC and Windows will automatically reinstall the drivers and fix any driver issues.<br>
							<strong>Method 3: Disable USB selective suspend</strong>
							USB Selective Suspend is a Windows power saving feature that suspends unused or idle USB ports to conserve power. Sometimes it could stop a USB port from working. Here is how to disable it:
							Press Windows + R keys and type powercfg.cpl in the Run dialog to open Windows Power options.
							Here click on Change plan settings next to your current plan and then click on Change advanced power settings.
							Now, expand USB settings and disable USB selective suspend setting.
							Restart the PC to see if it fixes the USB port issue. 
							</div><br>

							<div id="wifidisconnecting"><h2>PC keeps disconnecting from WiFi</h2> 
							If your Wi-Fi is working fine but your PC keeps disconnecting from it, then your PC’s network card may not be receiving full power. Windows has a built-in power saver option that gives less power to the network card. You need to disable this feature:
							<br>
							Go to Advanced settings in the Power Options.
							Here expand Wireless Adaptor Settings and then expand Power Saving Mode.
							Set this to Maximum Performance.
							</div><br>

							<div id="beeps"><h2>PC keeps making beeping sound</h2> 
							If the PC doesn’t start after the beeps, then it’s usually difficult to solve the problem yourself. However, I’m going to list down two of the most common problems due to which beeps occur, and thankfully, you can solve them yourself as well.
							<strong>Problem 1: Out of place RAM</strong>
							A problem I recently dealt with. If the RAM inside your PC gets loose or out of place, then your PC will beep 2-3 times and won’t boot at all. The solution is simple, open up the PC (laptop users should let an expert handle this) and reinsert the RAM. Here’s how:
							<br>
							Take out the RAM completely and clean any dirt inside the slot using a cotton bud.
							Now insert back the RAM and put enough pressure on both ends to ensure it is fully inside.
							Afterward, close the clips and make sure they’re properly locked. Even a slightly loose RAM will be unable to work.
							<br>
							<strong>Problem 2: Recently added hardware</strong>
							A damaged or wrongly installed hardware component could lead to beeps. Take out any newly added hardware components and see if it solves the problem. If the PC works fine afterward, then either get it installed properly or get it fixed (or replaced).
							</div><br>

							<div id="fans"><h2>PC Fans not working</h2> 
							If you notice one or more fans in your PC aren’t working, then it could be due to the dirt inside. You will have to open up the PC and use a compressed air can or a leaf blower to clean up the fans and other components.
							<br>
							If dirt wasn’t the problem, then you can also use the SpeedFan app to see what is the problem. The app will let you control the fans to make them work again. Although your PC motherboard must support fan control to use this app.
							</div><br>

							<div id="overworkingfan"><h2>Overworking fan</h2> 
							Your PC fan runs according to how much your PC is heating. The higher the temperature, the faster the fan will run. In case your PC temperature is fine (you can use HWMonitor to check it), but the fan is running at full speed; then you’ll have to manually control it.
							<br>
							You can use the SpeedFan app for this purpose as well. It will tell you the running speed of all the fans inside your PC so you can manage their speed. Don’t worry about app compatibility, overworking fan problem only happens with motherboards that can control the fans.
							</div><br>

							<div id="pccrash"><h2>PC crashes before loading the OS</h2> 
							If your PC only shows manufacturer logo and then crashes right before it was supposed to load the operating system, then it’s a problem with RAM or hard disk. As the OS is unable to load, then either the RAM is corrupted and can’t hold the boot loader or the hard drive is damaged and can’t load data inside it.
							If you have multiple RAM slots, then taking out each one of them one by one and starting the PC will help find the culprit. In the end, you will have to replace the corrupted RAM or the hard disk, whichever has the issue.
							</div><br>

							<div id="noisy"><h2>Noisy PC</h2> 
							If you hear a lot of extra noise while using the PC, then most probably it is a plea to clean it up.
							Get it cleaned or use a can of compressed air or leaf blower to clean it up yourself. If you have overclocked your 
							PC GPU and CPU, then they could be the reason for the noise as well.
							<br>							
							CD-ROM and other disc drives may generate noises when the drive is accessed. Disc drive noise should be a soft whirling noise when the CD-ROM drive is accessed and only be generated when the CD-ROM is accessed.<br>
							It is abnormal for a CD-ROM to experience any of the symptoms below:<br>
							i) No noise.<br>
							ii) Clicking while accessing the CD-ROM.<br>
							iii) Noises when the CD-ROM is not being accessed or no disc in the drive.<br>
							iv) If any of the issues above occur, the drive is likely defective, and we recommend it be replaced.<br>
							v) The computer hard drive is a common issue for additional noise. It is normal for a hard drive to produce noise.<br> vi) Normal noises should expect to hear include a low humming or quiet whistling sound.<br>
							vii) Noises you should not expect to hear are repetitive clicking, very noticeable humming, knocking, or any hard thump.<br> viii) If you hear any of these noises, we recommend the hard drive be looked at or replaced, as it may be going bad.<br>
							</div><br>

							<div id="monitor"><h2>Monitor goes black after few seconds</h2> 
							If the monitor goes black after few seconds of display, then it could be a problem with the color quality or screen adjustment. Press the auto-adjust button on your monitor to see if it fixes it. If not, then you will have to change display color from 32bit to 16 bit.<br>
							You can connect the PC to another monitor to adjust colors from your graphics card settings. Pressing the auto-adjust may show the display for few seconds. You can use this to your advantage and adjust the color while pressing auto-adjust.
							</div><br>

							<div id="pcpower"><h2>PC isn’t powering on</h2> 
							If your PC is not powering on at all – not even a single light in it, then it must be a problem with the power source.

							Desktop users: If your PC’s extension cord, power outlet, and other connections are working fine, then the problem may be with the PC’s power cable. Replace the power cable of the monitor with the CPU’s (if you don’t have a spare) to see if it turns on. You’ll have to get a new power cable if this fixes the problem.

							Laptop users: Take out the battery and put it back before starting the laptop. If this doesn’t work, then take out the battery again and connect the charging cable to the laptop. Start the PC on charger power and see if it works. You will have to replace the battery if it fixes the problem.

							Note: You should also remove all types of external devices connected to your PC while trying this. A malfunctioning device might cause this issue.
